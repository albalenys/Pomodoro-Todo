# Pomodoro-Todo
Todo list that implements the pomodoro technique.
Users are able to create tasks and start a timer to complete each task.
After working on each task, the user will gain a pomodoro.
After four pomodoros, users are able to start another timer for a break.

### Future Updates

- Create pomodoros only after timer is finished.
- Ensure app works with javascript disabled.
- Responsive layout.
- Pause button for timers.
- Add 'back to top' button for long lists.
- Use sweetAlert for deleting tasks.
